# Open Source Me

This project is dedicated to the people who want to take part in an open source project but can't find a project with the technology they want to use.

## How it works

But the aim is to see what repos exist on gitHub, browsing the issues and categorize these into groups that use a common technology, framework, or stack.

## Version

This is just a POC right now.
